# BIRCH-Clustering-on-make_circles-dataset
Applied BIRCH clustering on the make_circles dataset to explore its performance on non-linear, circular data. The project includes data preprocessing, cluster visualization, and analysis of BIRCHâ€™s behavior, highlighting its efficiency and limitations when handling non-convex cluster shapes in unsupervised learning tasks.
